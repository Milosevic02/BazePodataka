In our practice sessions, we covered various aspects of SQL. We learned how to use the `ANY` and `ALL` operators for conditional filtering of data based on specific values. We also practiced using functions like `NVL` and `COALESCE` for data manipulation. We learned how to count, calculate sums, averages, and round values using functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `ROUND`.

Furthermore, we practiced nested `SELECT` statements, grouping data using the `GROUP BY` clause, and applying the `HAVING` clause to filter groups of data.

We also worked on joining data from multiple tables and combining columns in different queries. This is just the beginning of understanding SQL, and the skills we acquired in these exercises will be valuable for working with various types of databases and complex queries.

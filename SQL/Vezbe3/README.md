# SQL Practice - Database Analysis

In our SQL practice sessions, we explored various aspects of SQL and acquired new knowledge and skills in working with databases. Here's an overview of what we added to our skill set during these exercises:

## New Skills and Concepts

- **Using Two Identical Tables:** We learned how to effectively use two identical tables in queries, which is useful for comparing data between the same tables.

- **EXISTS and NOT EXISTS:** We familiarized ourselves with the use of EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators for data filtering within subqueries.

- **Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS):** We learned how to use set operations to combine, intersect, and differentiate data from different tables, allowing us to analyze different data sets.

- **JOIN Operations:** We explored various types of JOIN operations such as INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to connect data from different tables.

- **Working with CASE Statements:** We practiced using CASE statements for data classification and analysis.

- **Solving Different Tasks:** We worked on diverse tasks, including finding the oldest employee, identifying employees not assigned to projects, and similar requirements.

These new skills are crucial for efficiently handling and analyzing data in SQL and open doors for solving various database-related problems and challenges.
